# deep_python_23b_aalitvinov

A repository containing my homework solutions for <https://github.com/mailcourses/deep_python_autumn_2023>.

All HW solutions are `python-poetry` projects. To test a particular one, _clone_ this repository, _cd_ into folder
with HW solution (e.g. **01**, **02** etc.) and follow the instructions of their local `README`s.
